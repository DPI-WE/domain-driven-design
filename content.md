# Embracing Complexity with Domain-Driven Design ðŸ’¡
Having explored the utility and elegance of Service Objects, it's time to dive deeper and discover the transformative power of Domain-Driven Design. This approach will not only enrich your understanding of complex business logic but also teach you how to encapsulate this logic within rich domain models, elevating your Rails applications to new heights of clarity and maintainability.

## The Essence of Domain-Driven Design
At its core, Domain-Driven Design is about understanding and reflecting the complexity of the business environment through your application's architecture. It focuses on placing the domain and the logic of the business at the forefront of the development process, encouraging developers to speak the same language as domain experts (business analysts, stakeholders, etc.).

### Rich Domain Models: More Than Just Data
In the context of Domain-Driven Design, a domain model isn't just a representation of data in your database; it's a living blueprint of the business logic. These models should encapsulate the behaviors, rules, and logic that define the domain, making them rich in functionality and not just data storage entities.

### Crafting Rich Domain Models
Let's put theory into practice by enhancing a Rails model with behaviors and logic that reflect the intricacies of our domain. Suppose we're building a platform for managing events. An event in our system has complexities beyond just its date, location, and attendees. It involves scheduling, capacity management, and notifications.

1. Defining Behaviors in the Model
First, let's enrich our Event model by adding business logic directly related to events.

```ruby
# app/models/event.rb
class Event < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :attendees
  validates :name, :date, :location, presence: true

  def reschedule(new_date)
    # Business logic to reschedule an event
    self.date = new_date
    notify_attendees
  end

  def add_attendee(user)
    # Logic to add an attendee, considering capacity constraints
    return false if attendees.count >= capacity
    attendees << user
    true
  end

  private

  def notify_attendees
    # Logic to notify all attendees about the event rescheduling
    attendees.each do |attendee|
      # Send notification to attendee
    end
  end
end
```

2. Interacting with the Enhanced Model
Now, with our rich domain model, actions like rescheduling an event or adding an attendee encapsulate all necessary checks, validations, and side effects (e.g., notifications).

```ruby
# Rescheduling an event
event = Event.find(params[:id])
event.reschedule(params[:new_date])

# Adding an attendee to an event
event.add_attendee(current_user)
```

## The Benefits of Rich Domain Models
- **Encapsulation**: Business logic is kept where it belongs, within the domain model itself, leading to cleaner controllers and services.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: The model reflects the language and complexity of the business domain, making it easier for developers and domain experts to communicate.
- **Flexibility**: Business rules and behaviors encapsulated in the model can be easily modified or extended, enhancing the application's ability to evolve with the business.

## Refactor Order Processing Logic into a Domain Model
Let's refactor the business logic for order processing, currently embedded in a controller, into the Order domain model. This will demonstrate the encapsulation of business logic within the domain model, making the controller leaner and the model richerâ€”a key practice in Domain-Driven Design.

### Initial Controller Code

```ruby
# app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @order = Order.new(order_params)
    if @order.save
      # TODO: move this business logic to the model layer
      if @order.total_price >= 100
        @order.update(discount_applied: true, discount_amount: 10)
      end
      redirect_to order_path(@order), notice: 'Order was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def order_params
    params.require(:order).permit(:customer_id, :total_price, :discount_applied, :discount_amount)
  end
end
```

### Task: Refactor to Order Model
Now we'll refactor the order discount logic into the Order model. The Order model should automatically apply a discount if certain conditions are met, encapsulating this business rule within the model itself.

<aside>
  You may want to use an [active record callback](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html) to automatically apply a discount before saving a record.
</aside>

```ruby
# app/models/order.rb
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :apply_discount

  private

  def apply_discount
    if total_price >= 100 && !discount_applied?
      self.discount_applied = true
      self.discount_amount = 10 # Assume 10 is the discount amount for the simplicity
    end
  end
end
```
<!-- TODO: make it a coding exercise later when we can use ActiveRecord
{: .repl #order title="Order Model" readonly_lines="[1,2,3,4,5]"}

```ruby
# spec/models/order_spec.rb
RSpec.describe Order, type: :model do
  it 'applies a discount on orders over $100' do
    order = Order.create(customer_id: 1, total_price: 150)
    expect(order.discount_applied).to be true
    expect(order.discount_amount).to eq(10)
  end
```
{: .repl-test #order_model_test_1 for="order" title="Order Model applies discounts correctly > 100" points="2" }

```ruby
RSpec.describe Order, type: :model do
  it 'does not apply a discount on orders under $100' do
    order = Order.create(customer_id: 1, total_price: 99)
    expect(order.discount_applied).to be false
    expect(order.discount_amount).to be_nil
  end
end
```
{: .repl-test #order_model_test_2 for="order" title="Order Model applies discounts correctly < 100>" points="2" }

-->

Now our `OrdersController` can simply save an `Order` without having to apply discounts (or be concerned with any new business logic we add later).

```ruby
# app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @order = Order.new(order_params)
    if @order.save
      redirect_to order_path(@order), notice: 'Order was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def order_params
    params.require(:order).permit(:customer_id, :total_price, :discount_applied, :discount_amount)
  end
end
```

By encapsulating business rules within the model, we create a more maintainable and understandable application architecture. This not only simplifies the controller but also aligns the model more closely with the business domain it represents.
